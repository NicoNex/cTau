# Ï„

Tau is a dynamically-typed open source programming language designed to be minimal, fast and efficient.

# This repo is unmantained
After a while I managed to implement just the VM and the object system from this repo to the main one, so that's where the development continued. For this reason I decided to archive this repository. For the main one please visit [Tau](https://github.com/NicoNex/tau).

## CTau
This is an experimental version of the Tau interpreter written in C that is currently work in progress and incomplete.
For a stable Tau version refer to the installation section below. However if you would like to help with the development of CTau either by contributing code or suggestions you're more than welcome to do so.

If you're interested in the main project refer to [here](https://github.com/NicoNex/tau).

## Installation (for stable Tau only)
In order to install Tau, you'll need [Go](https://golang.org/).

Once done, running the following command will successfully install the tau interpreter:
```bash
go install github.com/NicoNex/tau/cmd/tau@latest
```

You can try it out in the terminal by simply running `$ tau`, alternatively to take advantage of the builtin virtual machine and gain a lot of performance run it with `$ tau -vm`.
The flag `-vm` works when executing files too.
For additional info run `$ tau --help`.

## Syntax

### Hello World
_We all start from here..._
```python
println("Hello World")
```

### Examples

#### File
As every interpreter Tau supports files either by passing the path to the interpreter or by using the shebang.

```python
#!/path/to/tau

println("hello world")
```

```
$ tau helloworld.tau
hello world
```

#### if-else blocks

```python
if 1 > 0 {
	println("yes")
} else {
	println("no")
}
```

```python
myVar = 10

if myVar > 10 {
	println("more than 10")
} else if myVar == 10 {
	println("it's exactly 10")
} else {
	println(myVar)
}
```

#### Declaring a function
```python
loop = fn(times, function) {
	if times > 0 {
		function()
		loop(times-1, function)
	}
}

loop(5, fn() { println("Hello World") })
```

#### Noteworthy features
The return value can be implicit:
```python
add = fn(x, y) { x + y }
sum = add(9, 1)
println(sum)
```
```
>>> 10
```

Also you can inline the if expressions:
```rust
a = 0
b = 1

minimum = if a < b { a } else { b }
```

The semicolon character `;` is implicit on a newline but can be used to separate multiple expressions on a single line.
```python
printData = fn(a, b, c) { println(a); println(b); println(c) }
```

Functions are first-class and treated as any other data type.
```python
min = fn(a, b) {
	if a < b {
		return a
	}
	b
}

var1 = 1
var2 = 2

m = min(var1, var2)
println(m)
```
```
>>> 1
```

##### Error handling
```python
# errtest.tau

div = fn(n, d) {
	if d == 0 {
		return error("zero division error")
	}
	n / d
}

if failed(result1 = div(16, 2)) {
	exit(result1)
}
println("the result of 16 / 2 is", result1)

if failed(result2 = div(32, 0)) {
	exit(result2)
}
println("the result of 32 / 0 is", result2)
```
```
$ tau errtest.tau
the result of 16 / 2 is 8
error: zero division error
$
```

#### Concurrency
Tau supports go-style concurrency. 
This is obtained by the use of four builtins `pipe`, `send`, `recv` `close`. 
- `pipe` creates a new FIFO pipe and optionally you can pass an integer to it to create a buffered pipe.
- `send` is used to send values to the pipe.
- `recv` is used to receive values from the pipe.
- `close` closes the pipe.

Pipes can be buffered or unbuffered. Buffered pipes make the tau-routine sleep once `send` is called until at least one value is read from the pipe.
Once `recv` is called on an empty pipe it will cause the tau-routine to sleep until a new value is sent to the pipe.
`send` is used to send values to the pipe.
`close` closes the pipe thus allowing it to be garbage collected. 
Calling `recv` on a closed pipe will return `null`.

```python
# concurrency_example.tau

listen = fn(p) {
	for val = recv(p) {
		println(val)
	}
	println("bye bye...")
}

p = pipe()
tau listen(p)

send(p, "hello")
send(p, "world")
send(p, 123)
send(p, "this is a test")
close(p)
```

##### REPL
Tau also supports REPL:
```
>>> add = fn(a, b) { a + b }
>>> string(add)
fn(a, b) { (a + b) }
>>> string(21)
21
>>> recursiveLoop = fn(n, func) { if n != 0 { func(n); recursiveLoop(n-1, func) } }
>>> recursiveLoop(10, fn(n) { println("hello", n) })
hello 10
hello 9
hello 8
hello 7
hello 6
hello 5
hello 4
hello 3
hello 2
hello 1
```

### Data types
Tau is a dynamically-typed programming language and it supports the following primitive types:

#### Integer
```python
myVar = 10
```

#### Float
```python
myVar = 2.5
```

#### String
```python
myString = "My string here"
```
Tau also supports strings interpolation.
```python
temp = 25
myString = "The temperature is { if temp > 20 { \"hot\" } else { \"cold\" } }"
println(myString)
```
```
>>> The temperature is hot
```
For raw strings use the backtick instead of double quotes.
```python
s = `this is a raw string\n {}`
println(s)
```
```
>>> this is a raw string\n {}
```

#### Boolean
```js
t = true
f = false
```

#### Function
```python
pow = fn(base, exponent) {
	if exponent > 0 {
		return base * pow(base, exponent-1)
	}
	1 # You could optionally write 'return 1', but in this case the return is implicit.
}
```

#### List
```js
empty = []
stuff = ["Hello World", 1, 2, 3, true]
```

#### Map
```js
empty = {}
stuff = {"Hello": "World", 123: true}
```

#### Loop
```python
for i = 0; i < 10; ++i {
	println("hello world", i)
}

lst = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

println(lst)
for len(lst) > 0 {
	println(lst = tail(lst))
}
```

#### Objects
```python
obj = new()
obj.value1 = 123
obj.value2 = 456

obj.sumValues = fn() {
	obj.value1 + obj.value2
}

obj.child = new()
obj.child.value = obj.sumValues()
```

##### Recommended usage
```python
Dog = fn(name, age) {
	dog = new()

	dog.name = name
	dog.age = age

	dog.humanage = fn() {
		dog.age * 7
	}

	return dog
}

snuffles = Dog("Snuffles", 8)
println(snuffles.humanage())
```
```
>>> 56
```

#### Files
It's possible to open files with the `open` builtin. 
The aforementioned builtin supports the following file modes:
- `r` opens a file read-only and it's the default mode when no mode is specified.
- `w` opens a file write-only truncating it to zero length. If the file doesn't exist it creates it.
- `a` opens a file in append mode for reading and writing and it creates it if doesn't exist.
- `x` opens a file in exclusive mode for reading and writing, if the file doesn't exist it creates it and fails otherwise.
- `rw` opens a file for reading and writing truncating it to zero length first.

```python
# file_example.tau

f = open("myfile.txt")
content = f.Read()
f.Close()
```

```python
# file_example.tau

f = open("myfile.txt", "a")
content = f.Read()
f.Write("Hello World")
f.Close()

println("previous content: {content}")
```

#### Modules
##### Import
When importing a module only the fields whose name start with an upper-case character will be exported.
Same thing applies for exported objects, in the example `Snuffles` is exported but the field `id` won't be visible ouside the module.
```python
# import_test.tau

data = 123

printData = fn() {
	println(data)
}

printText = fn() {
	println("example text")
}

TestPrint = fn() {
	printData()
	printText()
}

dog = fn(name, age) {
	d = new()
	d.Name = name
	d.Age = age
	d.id = 123

	d.ID = fn() {
		d.id
	}

	return d
}

Snuffles = dog("Mr Snuffles", 5)

```

```python
it = import("import_test")

it.TestPrint()

println(it.Snuffles.Name)
println(it.Snuffles.Age)
println(it.Snuffles.ID())
```

```
>>> 123
>>> example text
>>> Mr Snuffles
>>> 5
>>> 456
```

##### Plugin
Tau plugin system makes it possible to import and use Go plugins in Tau seamlessly.
To run your Go code in Tau just compile it with:
```bash
go build -buildmode=plugin -o myplugin.so
```
then you can import it in Tau with the `plugin` builtin function.
```python
myplugin = plugin("path/to/myplugin.so")
```
###### Example
Go code:
```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func Hello() {
	fmt.Println("Hello World")
}

func Sum(a, b int) int {
	return a + b
}
```

Tau code:
```python
myplugin = plugin("myplugin.so")

myplugin.Hello()
println("The sum is", myplugin.Sum(3, 2))
```
Output:
```
>>> Hello World
>>> The sum is 5
```
